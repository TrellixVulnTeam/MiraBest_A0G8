# MiraBest

The MiraBest Batched Dataset is a labelled dataset of Fanaroff-Reilly (FR) galaxies drawn from [Miraghaei and Best 2017](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/466/4/4346/2843096). At present, the dataset consists only of sources identified as confidently classified sources with classic morphology, displaying no unusual structure or features.

## The MiraBest Batched Dataset

The MiraBest Batched Dataset is comprised of a total of 792 images of two classes: FR I (class 0, 351 images) and FR II (class 1, 441 images). Images were obtained from the VLA FIRST sky survey via SkyView virtual telescope.  All images have dimensions of 150 x 150 pixels, with one pixel equivalent to an angular size of 1.8". The dataset is split into a training set of 704 images, with the remaining 88 images comprising the test set.
